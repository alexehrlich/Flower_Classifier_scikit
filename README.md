###IRIS

This project trains a Feed Forward Neural network with pytorch or uses a K Nearest Neighbor with scikit-learn to predict the species from the IRIS data set.

##Usage
- `make setup`to install the libaries
- `make KNN`to run the K Nearest Neighbor Classification+
- `make FNN` to train a fully connected Feed Forward Neural Network
