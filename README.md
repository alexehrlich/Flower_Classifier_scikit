### IRIS

This simple demo trains a Feed Forward Neural network with pytorch or uses a K Nearest Neighbor with scikit-learn to predict the species from the IRIS data set.

## KNearestNeighbor
Makes PCA to reduse the 4 dimensional input vecor [sepal width, sepal length, petal width, petal length] to a 2 dimensional vector using PCA to make a scatter plot to easily make the clusters visible.

## Feed Forwar Network
Trains a model with one hidden layer. Moves the tensors to the GPU for faster execution. 

## Usage
- `make setup`to install the libaries
- `make KNN`to run the K Nearest Neighbor Classification+
- `make FNN` to train a fully connected Feed Forward Neural Network
